## Core Azure Sets

#### [Azure Docs](azure-docs)
Scraped from main Azure docs site, all major Azure services are in here plus a couple of other useful icons. The main place to start if what you require is an icon for a top level Azure service 

#### ['Official' Azure Icons Set](azure-icons)
This is the official "Microsoft Azure Icon Repository" set from the Microsoft Cloud Design Studio, the best place to look if you're after an Azure service or other icon from the Azure Portal. There will be an overlap with the Azure Docs set, but there's nearly four times the number of icons here.

#### [Azure Patterns Collection](azure-patterns)
Very large set of 1200+ icons including many Azure services, but mostly focused on other concepts, actions and gyphs. This has been scraped from https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/patterns/styles/glyphs-icons/ This is made public, as part of the "Sundog" Azure.com design system

#### [Microsoft 'Cloud and AI' Set (Outdated)](cloud-old)
This is the old official "Microsoft Azure Cloud and AI Symbol / Icon Set - SVG" dated 15/05/2019 fetched from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=41937). It is extremely outdated, and has many overlaps with the other sets, but also contains many unique icons. It's included here in entirety for completeness


## Other Sets

#### [Logos & Brands](logos)
Various product, company & programing language logos, hand picked & fetched from various sources online. Theses may or may not be directly Azure related

#### [Other Icons](other)
Many other Azure & Microsoft icons sourced from various places; Azure.com pages, Azure Docs git repo, Azure portal etc. Most of these are hand picked or moved here manually, these shouldn't overlap with the other sets, but may do
